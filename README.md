# CPSC 210 Personal Project:  Course Planner

## Project Proposal

This is a course planning application that allows users to maintain several worklists on their local directories, in
which users may customize and manage their own university courses. The application also allows users to check and
modifies the properties of the courses in their worklists, as well as providing useful statistics and tips for course
registration.

This application is designed to facilitate undergraduate students during their course registration process. As an
undergrad myself, I always spent too many hours in planning my course schedules. I hope this application could help
students to simplify their course planning processes at the start of every term.

*Note: The properties of a course (e.g., course code, course name, credits, etc.) and some test cases are referenced
